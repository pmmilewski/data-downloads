Now that you've read in the files and found some interesting columns, you can dig in and analyze the data more. There are quite a few interesting angles you could explore:

    Review expulsions (which refers to when students are kicked out of school permanently). Columns like SCH_DISCWODIS_EXPWOE_HI_M and TOT_DISCWODIS_EXPZT_F contain information on expulsions.
    Explore gender and race differences in SAT scores. Columns like SCH_SATACT_HI_M contain this information.
    Figure out the racial and gender breakdowns for different types of schools, such as magnet schools.
    Determine how many students are in gifted and talented programs, or advanced placement classes.
    Investigate how racial differences in enrollment change from preschool to high school.
    Explore school bullying. The SCH_HBDISCIPLINED_DIS_HI_M column contains some of this information.
